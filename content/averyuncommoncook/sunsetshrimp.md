The best thing about this recipe is — okay, the best things are the number of pieces of cutlery, dishes, and prep items it requires and how it tastes. Also how easy it is.

I’m pretty lucky: I have a dishwasher in my apartment (at the moment; I’ll be moving in August to a place that doesn’t have one). But it’s pretty small, wedged in as it is between the sink and the wall. This is a meal that doesn’t fill it up, require much counter space, or send me haring off to far corners of Manhattan or the Bronx for esoteric ingredients to lug back on the subway.

The sauce is a gorgeous, shimmery orange-gold, and the shrimp cook to that deep, recognizable pink; the herbs and orange zest floating in the liquid provide darker notes, of green and orange. Try to cook this in a dish you can bring straight to the table; decanting is not something you want bother with for something this simple.

In general, I find that a quarter-pound of shrimp per person — for a main dish — is a good proportion; I’m giving measurements for a two-person meal. Obviously, tweak to your needs.

Oven: 450 F, 230 C, gas mark 8.

Heat a few tablespoons of olive oil in an oven-safe baking dish on the stovetop. When it’s warm, add fresh or dried herbs (rosemary and/or tarragon are highly recommended; a few teaspoons of fresh or half a teaspoon dried of each; a quick shake of dried red pepper flakes adds an interesting kick of heat) and put it in the preheated oven to heat further. When the herbs begin to sizzle, pull the baking dish out and add half a pound of peeled shrimp, a few teaspoons of chopped orange zest, a quarter to a half cup of orange juice, and salt and black pepper to taste. Return to the oven and roast for eight to ten minutes.

Serve with bread to mop up the sauce, which you will not want to ignore: it’s sweet and herby, with the salt and pepper keeping it from being cloying. I had it with lightly toasted ciabiatta, which was perfect, the satiny interior absorbing the sauce so it didn’t drip everywhere, and the crust providing textural contrast, and a salad full of crisp, colorful vegetables.

Total number of items that ended up in the dishwasher: 7 (cutting board — upon which I peeled the shrimp — vegetable peeler — I know, I need a zester, but currently don’t possess one — baking dish, serving spoon, dinner plate, fork, water glass).
