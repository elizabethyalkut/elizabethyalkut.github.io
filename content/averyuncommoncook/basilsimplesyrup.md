On a visit to Ye Olde Family Homestead recently, I managed to eat pesto, not once, not twice, but *three times*. In one day.

Look, it was a short visit. I didn’t have much time.

And then I had a container of ziti with pesto for the train ride back to New York.

Yes, I like pesto. A lot. Basil is probably my favorite herb, and when you combine anything with olive oil, cheese, and garlic, it is, as I have noted before, very hard to go wrong.

So now, the basil-addiction centers of my brain having been activated, I made some basil simple syrup and am drinking lots and lots and lots of sparkling basil lemonades, basil-and-vodka-tonics, watermelon basil martinis — suffice it to say if it’s alcoholic, there has been basil involved in it for the past few days. When I get fruit at the farmer’s market this weekend, strawberries or blueberries or peaches, I will be tossing the fruit with the simple syrup and having it for a basil-y dessert.

The word basil no longer looks like a real word.

Basil simple syrup is really easy. Combine water and sugar in a two-parts-sugar, one-part-water ratio (e.g., one cup of water, two cups of sugar; a half-cup of water, one cup of sugar) in a small saucepan. Don’t go overboard with how much you make — this stuff packs a pretty intense flavor, and since it involves a fresh herb, I suspect it wouldn’t keep especially well. (I wouldn’t know since it never survives long before being finished, in my life.) Add one part washed-and-patted-dry basil, and bring the whole thing to a gentle simmer over low-to-medium heat, stirring occasionally.

When the sugar has dissolved completely, remove from heat and allow to cool. Strain and store in the fridge.
