# Elizabeth Yalkut

![Elizabeth Yalkut's monogram, an E and Y connected][logo] I’m a twentysomething (left ambiguous only because I’ll never remember to change it) writer in New York City, who graduated from Emma Willard School and Barnard College, Columbia University. I spend just as much time on the subway as you’d expect, drink more tea than you’d think, and eat less sushi than I’d like to.

## Site
